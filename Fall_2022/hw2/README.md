HW #1 Assignments 

In this assignments, you will get familiar with Xilinx tool chain and Verilog. 

To install vivado, please see vivado install instruction in the class
homepage (vivado_install_steps.html). 

Please checkout hw1 folder from the github
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gt-cs3220/gt-cs3220.github.io.git
```
and then go to https://github.com/gt-cs3220/gt-cs3220.github.io/tree/master/Fall_2022/hw2

Check out the following tutorial (https://github.com/gt-cs3220/gt-cs3220.github.io/tree/master/Vivado_Tutorial) 

The following video gives you a step by process for creating a simulation project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KesfzF9z6Aw

Task #1: create a new vivado project
1- give a name for your project
2- select RTL project as project type
3- add the source files: design1.v and design2.v
4- skip contraints option
5- use the default part
6- click File -> "Add Sources"
7- click "Add or create simulaiton sources"
8- add testbench.v
9- clock "Simulation" -> "Run Simulation"
10- check out the generated simulation waveform

Task #2: Modify testbench.v to use design2 module.
11- run the simulation again
12- check out the generated simulation waveform

Once you are done, please answer the question in Canvas HW#1 quiz section.
