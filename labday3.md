Lab day #3  Assignments 

(Due : 2/17/21)



In this assignment, you will use assignment #3 frame. 
The purpose of lab day #3 assignment is to help you start on assignment # 3. 

Before you start lab3, please watch assignment3_help.mp4 video. 

step 1. create a project file and do run simulation.  

step 2. execute (synthesis, implementation)

step 3. based on your pipeline design, idetnify what signals need to be propgated. 
i.e.) what signals should be in from_de_to_fe from_wb_to_de etc. 


step 4. modify the PC increment logic in the FE stage. 
PC will be increamented by instruction size every cycle 

step 5. progagate PC value to all the pipeline latches. 
and add wires that shows PC contents. eg) PC_DE, PC_AGEX, PC_WB etc. 

step 6. add all PC value in each pipeline latch in the wave form. 
run simulation (Behavior simulation) 


run simulation (Behavior simulation) and get a screenshopt. 
 
**What to submit**: a screenshot of simulation.  

**Grading**: A screenshot that shows the PC value is incremented will be sufficient to get a full credit.
