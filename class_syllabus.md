**TAs**: Sam Jijina  and Yonghae Kim

**Note about TA office hours**: At this moment, we are holding virtual only office hours. We will revisit this policy as we progress in the semester. Each TA will be using a sign up sheet for their office hours. **The sign up sheet will be shared in the class Piazza**. Since we are using this approach each slot in the sign up sheet will be 10 minutes so that we can maximixe the number of teams we can help in one office hour session**.

**Communication method** 
Please use piazza private posting to communicate the instructor and the TAs. For general questions, please use piazza public posting so that other students can reply as well. 
 
**Participation points**
Students who provide helpful postings will receive extra participation points. (up to 3 points in total)

**Online platforms for resource**: We will use **Canvas** for assignment submissions and lecture note distributions. We will also use **Piazza** for discussions. 

In this course, we will study hardware implementation of architecture design. This is an intermediate-level course that follows CS2200. This course is a project-based course in which you will learn pipelined architectures by actually implementing simple instructions using an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) board. 

**Course Description**

 The course will strengthen the background knowledge of processor design by understanding timing issues, critical path, and other underlying hardware structures. It will also provide an understanding of architecture, hardware design  andincrease programming and debugging skills. 

 

**Topics:**

- FPGA programming, hardware description language (verilog)

- FPGA testing 

- Digital design 

- Pipeline design 

- Processor architecture 

- High-speed arithmetic

- Modern processors

- FPGA programming with High-level synthesis

- Accelerators for emerging workloads

- Pynq Boards 

- Xilinix tool chains 

- Background knowledge of compiler 

 

**Pre-requisite**:

Textbooks: All online books are available in the library . (http://library.gatech.edu/) 
- Principles and structures of FPGA (FPGA) 
- Quick start guide to verilog (verilog)
- Parallel programming for FPGAs (HLS) (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03648.pdf) 



FPGA boards: You will purchase Pynq boards from the Barnes& Nobel. The details will be provided in the class.


 

**Grading Scheme** 

**(Option #1)**

   Project assignment 1: 10 

   Project assignment 2: 15

   Project assignment 3: 10

   Project assignment 4: 15 

   Project assignment 5: 10 

  Project assignment 6: 15

  Home works: 10

  Final exam: 15

  participation: extra 3 points

**Option #2: Research track** 

Projects #1-#3, project #5, homework  are the same as option #1. 

Project #4,  Project #6,  and Final exam can be substituted with a research project. 

The research project topics will be announced in the later semester.

Research project options are limited to the students who have shown good standing in the course.

 

 

**Final grade algorithm** 

90 <=  score <= 100 : A 
80 <=   score < 90:  B 
70 <=   score < 80:  C 
60 <=   score < 70:  D 
  score < 60:  F 


A few notes: 

I plan to use non-curved grade assignment unless there are too few As. 

 

**FPGA boards & Programming Platforms**: We will use Xilinix Pynq boards for the class. Students are required to purchase their own boards. 

**Computing Resource**: Since FPGA board need to be physically connected with the Xilinix software, you need to have Xilinix tools in your local computer. It's your repsonsibility to install the necessary software (https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite/ise-webpack.html). We provide VMs as for your back-up option at your own risk. 

**Projects** Most of the projects are 2-student projects. Discussions with other students are encouraged. Submitting any work other than you and your partner's own is a violating of the Academic Honor Code. If you are not sure what you can discuss or not, please contact the instructor. 

**1-member team policy**: Most of the projects are 2-team member projects. A 1-member team can be approved by the instructor for some specific cases.  Please discuss with the instructor for the details. If you don't submit your project partner preference, we will randomly assign your partner.  



**Assignment late policy:** All assignments are due on the day specified by the assignment description and posted online. No late submissions are allowed except for the approval from the dean of students except for some assignments, there might be an option of late submission with penalty. The late submission information will be announced separately and by default no late submission. 


Assignment submission rules: You must follow the submission guidelines specified in the assignment description. We will use Canvas. Wrong file names, broken file formats, missing files will lose 5% of the grade. 

**Regrades:** Regrades are obtained by submitting a written explanation to the instructor within a week of when the work was returned in class. Regrades will only be discussed after submitting the work in this manner. In order for a test to be re-graded, you must neatly state in writing the reason that you would like your test to be re-graded. If a test is submitted for a re-grade, I have the right to re-grade the entire test-so keep it mind that it is possible to lose additional points. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you do not ask for a re-grade unless you have substantial reason to believe that I made a mistake when originally grading the test. All regrade requests should be done within one week after the semester is finished. 

**Office Hours:** Please respect the office hours of the instructor by planning ahead. Other times are possible by appointments. 

**Final exam**: A form of digital proctoring might be used in the final exam. 


**Academic Integrity**

The course will follow all relevant and appropriate Georgia Institute of Technology academic regulations (http://www.honor.gatech.edu). 

**Accommodations for Students with Disabilities**

The course process will follow all relevant and appropriate Georgia Institute of Technology academic regulations including those relevant to students with disabilities. Any students requiring additional assistance due to disabilities (e.g., learning disabilities) should contact the professor(s) during the first week of the semester. Students requiring extra time for examinations and quizzes are asked to make arrangements at least three days in advance. You may contact the Office of Disability Services (http://www.adapts.gatech.edu) regarding campus services.

**Discrimination and Harassment**

Georgia Tech does not discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, or veteran status in the administration of admissions policies, educational policies, employment policies, or any other Institute-governed programs and activities. This class adheres to those guidelines. Alternative viewpoints are welcome in this classroom. However, statements that are deemed racist, sexist, classist, or otherwise discriminatory toward others in the class will not be tolerated.

No form of harassment or discrimination is allowed in this class. In keeping with the professional nature of this course, only professional behavior is acceptable between the instructor and the students and between students. No harassment of any kind is allowed in class including but not limited to gender, age, ability, religion, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.

**Statement of Intent for Classroom Inclusivity**

As members of the Georgia Tech community, we are committed to creating a learning environment in which all of our students feel safe and included. Because we are individuals with varying needs, we are reliant on your feedback to achieve this goal. To that end, we invite you to enter into dialogue with us about the things we can stop, start, and continue doing to make our classroom an environment in which every student feels valued and can engage actively in our learning community.

**Class Mode**
The course will be also broadcasted by bluejean which the links are in the canvas for your convienence. Attendance will not be required except for the final exam. 
If you choose to attend the class in person, **please wear a mask inside the classroom**. 


**Homework**
Except for the first week, almost every wed has homework assignments. Homework assignments will be a mixture of a preparation for projects and simple questions to answer the lecture contents.
Homework assignments are individual but you can get help from others. If you get help from others, please include the names.
