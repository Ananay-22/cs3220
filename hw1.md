HW #1 Assignments 

**(Due : 8/29/21) 6pm EST**



In this assignments, you will get familiar with Xilinix tool chain and Verilog. 

Please checkout hw1 folder from the github (gt-cs3220-.github.io/hw1_files) 

**What to submit**: a screenshot of final simulation. 

**Grading**: submit a screenshot of the last task simulation (0.5 points) 

**Note**: HW #1 is intentionally designed for short tasks.  
  
The folder has two subfolders(example_v,simpleio_v) and simple two tasks. 

Task #1: create a new vivado project with  files only in the example_v folder). You start a new project and follow the instructions to set vivado projet including simulation configurations.  Try behavior simulation.  hw1 video shows how to create a project. Please check the "copy sources into project" option. 


Task #2: change the code (example_bus.v)  to have the following design in the module (use simple io folder) the simple in and out module based on the following definition.  simpleio_solution.v shows the correct answer that you can use it as a reference. 

```out1 =  in_1 & in_2 & in_3; ```

```out2 = in_1|in_2|in_3; ```

You can use the same testing code to test your designs.
