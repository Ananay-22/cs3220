Lab day #1 Assignments 

(Due : 1/27/21)



In this assignments, you will get familiar with Xilinix tool chain and verilog. 

Please checkout inclass-lab1 folder from the github. 

Before you start incalss-lab #1 assignments, please watch verilog_intro.mp4 and verilog_examples_part1.mp4. videos. 

**What to submit**: a screenshot of final simulation. 

**Grading**: submit any Xilinix tool screenshot (0.5 points), a screenshot of the last task simulation (full credit 1 point)

**Note**: Lab day #1 is intentionally designed for short tasks. If you complete lab day #1 tasks, we strongly recommend to start Lab day #2 tasks. 

we won't grade the correctness of tasks. However, we strongly encourage you to complete tasks and ask TAs/instructors during the lab day lecture hours if you face any problems. 

 

The folder has three subfolders( myxor, myxor_files simpleio) and simple three tasks. 

Task #1: start Vivado and try behavior myxor simulation. We provide all the source code in a project so it should run w/o any modifications. 



Task #2: create a new vivado project with myxor.v mytest.v files only in the myxor_files. You start a new project and follow the instructions to set vivado projet including simulation configurations.  Try behavior simulation. 



Task #3: complie the simple in and out module based on the following definition. 

out1 =  in_1 & in_2 & in_3; 

out2 = in_1|in_2|in_3; 

We provide testing module for your work.
