#Guide for accessing VM on ICE cluster

## Key Requirements
1. Internet connection
2. GT account (same as BuzzPort and Passport)

## Download and install GlobalProtect Clientless VPN
**Please Note!!!** Cisco AnyConnect is being officially sunseted by Georgia Tech. You may still be able to use it for a while, but we strongly encourage everyone to move to GlobalProtect since that removes one variable when trying to debug infrastructure issues as well as enables us to ask for technical support from OIT in case we face issues.
