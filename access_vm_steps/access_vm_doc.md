**Please Note!!!** Cisco AnyConnect is being officially sunseted by Georgia Tech. You may still be able to use it for a while, but we strongly encourage everyone to move to GlobalProtect since that removes one variable when trying to debug infrastructure issues as well as enables us to ask for technical support from OIT in case we face issues. 

Please follow instructions given at [https://gatech.service-now.com/home?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0026837](https://gatech.service-now.com/home?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0026837) to set up GlobalProtect. Individual instructions for different OS can be found here:
